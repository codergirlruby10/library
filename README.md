# Library
Library API using DRF and GraphQL

# Description
A data-driven library application powered by Django Rest Framework and Graphene. Applications allows for the creation of user accounts that require authenticated login.
The catalog portion allows users to implement complete CRUD functionality when inputting books and also allows user to search for books by either book name, or author.
The rating portion allows for user to give numerical rating to book and leave a comment which are authenticated and can only be created, edited or destroyed by post creator.
I used Graphene to gain experience with a new piece of software. I found it more aesethetic than Django Rest Framework alone but probably wont spend a huge amount of time
adding it to future projects as DRF seems to get the job done for the projects that I implement.

# Project Status
There is no front-end aspect to this project yet. At some point I will add that portion but for now I want to focus on getting compentant with backend development. But this
project is not over.
